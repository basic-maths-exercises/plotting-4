# Plotting functions

Now that you can plot a linear function over any range of integer values you are are ready to tackle something more complicated - a quadratic!  With that in mind I want you to write a program to produce a graph of the function:

This is a continuous function so it should be drawn with a continuous line.  Furthermore, in order to pass the tests, you will need to evaluate the function at 500 evenly spaced points between -10 and +10.  You must also include a point plotted at x=-10 and one plotted at x=+10.  I have started you off by giving setting the variable `xspacing` equal to the distance between each adjacent pair of points on the x-axis.
